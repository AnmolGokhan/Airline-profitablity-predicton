# **Problem Statement**

In the airline industry, maximizing profitability is a complex challenge influenced by multiple operational and financial factors. Given historical flight performance data, your task is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts **profit (USD)** for each flight based on features such as:

- **Flight delays**
- **Aircraft utilization**
- **Turnaround time**
- **Load factor**
- **Fleet availability**
- **Maintenance downtime**
- **Fuel efficiency**
- **Revenue**
- **Operating costs**

And moreâ€¦.

### Your model must be robust enough to handle real-world uncertainties, including:

- **Seasonal fluctuations**
- **Operational inefficiencies**
- **Cost variations**

- All while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model should provide **explainability** to help airline operators understand the key drivers of profitability and optimize decision-making.

The final model will be evaluated based on:

- **Prediction accuracy**
- **Interpretability**
- **Generalization to unseen data**
- 
## **Objective**

Develop a **high-performance ML model** to predict airline profitability and provide actionable insights for operational optimization.
